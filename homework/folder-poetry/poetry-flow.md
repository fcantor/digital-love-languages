## Leaving the house with ADHD
This folder poem is about a moment in my ADHD brain when I'm trying to leave the house.

- i am at home
  - _my bag is empty /script
  - i need my phone, wallet, and keys to leave
  - i should make some coffee too
  - ugh, this dress feels weird
  - i think i took my meds already but i'm not sure
  - let's check the bathroom /directory
    - awesome, there's my phone
    - i'm holding my phone
    - oops, i left my dirty clothes in here
    - putting my dirty clothes in the hamper outside...
  - _my bag is empty /script
  - wait, where did my phone go?
