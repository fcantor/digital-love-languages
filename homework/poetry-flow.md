## Leaving the house with ADHD
This folder poem is about a moment in my ADHD brain when I'm trying to leave the house.

- [the living room]
  ─ ! ! !  i need my phone, wallet, and keys to leave  ! ! !
  ─ alright, house, let's search
  ─ bag.txt
  ─ i should make some coffee too
  ─ i think i took my meds already but i'm not sure
  ─ meh, this dress feels weird suddenly
  ─ oh, hello anxiety, my old friend
  ─ okay, now to find my keys
  ─ [the bathroom]
    ─ awesome, there's my phone.txt
    ─ i put the phone in the bag, please don't lose your phone, cheska
    ─ oops, i left my dirty clothes in here
    ─ putting my dirty clothes in the wash...
    ─ very quick laundry.txt
    ─ wait, should i change while i'm in here?
  ─ [the bedroom]
    - oh, since i'm in here, i'll change real quick
    - should i dress like a cozy troll or a hot villain?
    - shoot, i need to make my bed
    - tada! i am dressed as a cute gremlin
    - that's a compromise, right?
    - ugh, i'm running late
  - wait, i need to find my keys


  ### Nice to haves
  Some nice features to add in later:
  - Creating `actions` and `thoughts` groups and categorizing files & directories into those groups
