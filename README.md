# About
This repo is where I'll be pushing up any work I'm doing and have submitted for the School of Poetic Computation's Digital Love Languages class (Spring 2022).

# Class Description
Digital Love Languages is a 10 week online class at the School for Poetic Computation stewarded by Melanie Hoff, Max Fowler, & Megna Dholakia.

Digital Love Languages: Communion, Consent, Refusal, Renewal is an introductory computing class for reimagining the core of technology’s purpose. This class is based on the premise that there is a world where all our software is made by people who love us and that we can contribute to building it. Digital Love Languages is an experiment in computational communion disguised as a class.

In this class, we will learn about things as a proxy to learn about other things. Learn about digital coding to learn how we’re socially coded. Learn about digital consent to learn about sexual consent. Learn about network protocols to learn about sharing. Learn about naming to learn about knowing. Learn about learning to learn about living.

Together, we will build small, personal software with Python HTML Bash and Javascript for affirming one another across physical distance while making and sharing digital space with each other. We will engage with code as a craft capable of expressing a full range of feeling and desire. We will look to the love letter as form, from the quill to the sext. We will explore social and digital consent and ask: How are they interwoven?.

Through a series of educational encounters, we will code poetic structures for digital touching and practice a re-examination of personal and networked computing. This is a call to action for expanding computation’s capacity for fostering interdependence and feeling among the immense personal and collective transformations brought on by COVID-19, collapse, and renewal.
